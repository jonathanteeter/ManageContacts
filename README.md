# ManageContacts
This is a full-stack application that lets users manage their contacts. Both the add and delete functions are currently supported.

## Design & Technology
* The application provides a form in which to view and update your contacts.
    * _Sequelize_ with a _MySQL_ database are used.
        * Sequelize uses promises to control async control-flow.
            * A promise represents a value which will be present at some point.
            * "I promise you I will give you a result or an error at some point."
        * MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
* Key technologies used to build this application are:
    * HTML and CSS -- Provides the means to create structured documents with style
    * Bootstrap -- Responsive Front-end framework
    * Handlebars -- Front-end templating engine
    * Node.js -- Server-side JavaScript environment
    * Express.js -- Node.js web server framework
    * Sequelize -- Promise-based Node.js Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
    * MySQL -- Relational Database Managed System (RDBMS)
    * Heroku -- Cloud Application Platform

## Challenges
* Understanding the proper use of Sequelize required practice.
